### Disable the Web Server

The switchâ€™s configuration files fall into two types: the running configuration file and the

start-up configuration file.

After you perform configurations on the sub-interfaces and click Apply, the modifications

will be saved in the running configuration file. The configurations will be lost when the

switch reboots.

If you need to keep the configurations after the switch reboots, please use the Save Config

function on the main interface to save the configurations in the start-up configuration file.
